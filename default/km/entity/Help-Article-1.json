    "body": "Yext Analytics provides you with an insights library that allows you to see a consolidated view of all the data that matters — in one place. You can easily see everything from how many clicks your promotions get, to the days and times when your Pages are the most popular, to how many people use Google Maps to get to your store. In addition to understanding your own performance, you also have the ability to see how your brand compares with local competitors in both search and ratings — giving you a complete look at how customers find and engage with your business. Why use Yext Analytics:  \nView information any way you\u0027d like with the ability to create customized dashboards that you can share with anyone who needs to see it — regardless of whether or not they have a Yext account.\n\nFind out how you stack up against competitors in local search. Choose keywords and see which of them you — and your competitors — are performing well for (and which you aren\u0027t) so you can make data\\-driven decisions about your next investments. Get a bird\u0027s eye view of your ratings across all your locations with Review Insights. In addition to performance metrics, you can see the total count and ratings of your reviews across your website and the entire Knowledge Network. Keep track of all actions taken in your account, and what happens behind the scenes with the Activity Log. If you\u0027re a Yext Partner, use this report to show your customers everything you do on their behalf. Or, share this log with your management.\n\n++How to use Yext Analytics:++  \n**Create a Custom Analytics Dashboard:**\n\n* Click Analytics in the top navigation bar.\n* Click on the Dashboard sub\\-tab.\n* Click on the + Add Custom Dashboard button on the left side of the page.\n\nTo learn more, see Create a Custom Analytics Dashboard.\n\n**Share an Analytics Dashboard:**\n\n* Click Analytics in the top navigation bar.\n* Click on the Dashboard sub\\-tab.\n* Click on the desired dashboard in the sidebar, and click on the Export button in the top right corner.\n\nTo learn more, see Share an Analytics Dashboard.\n\n**To adjust access to dashboards for users within the account, see Configure Dashboard share settings.**\n\n* Create a Custom Analytics Report:\n* Click Analytics in the top navigation bar.\n* Click on the Reports sub\\-tab.\n\nTo learn more, see Create a Custom Analytics Report.",
